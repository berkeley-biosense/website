Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable the control of a
computer without muscular action. BCIs based on electroencephalography (EEG) have improved dramatically over the past five years, but their head-worn form factor and awkward visibility have challenged their wider adoption. 

In these projects, we use a home-rigged, single-electrode EEG placed inside the ear canal (above) to investigate how signals from the ear could be used for "mental gestures," and for passthought-style authentication (see our [past work on passthoughts](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~chuang/passthoughts/).
