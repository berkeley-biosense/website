# Imagining and framing new technologies through concept videos

Richmond Wong, Dierdre Mulligan
This paper explores corporate concept videos frame new and emergent technologies and how they embed a vision about the future of computing - including how computing should be done, for whom, and what social norms might exist. We introduce a method for critiquing and analyzing concept videos, using the lens of design fiction, that surfaces social values and narratives embedded in the videos. We analyze Google Glass’ and Microsoft HoloLens’ concept videos as two case studies. We also analyze early media reactions to these technologies to see how media authors imagine the future with Glass or HoloLens. We then introduce the language of "anticipatory" and "speculative" orientations toward the future to better describe how people imagine sociotechnical futures.
