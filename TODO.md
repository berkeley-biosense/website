# Project pages
. .
- More 'obvious' titles for Rich and Noura projects
- Noura's could use a flashier image
- Plug sync brainwave dataset, too?
- Citations/References on project page with complete citations, incl PDFs

# Main page
...
- Link to People page obviously from header
- More of a blue (light blue) link hover color
- Any plugins for prettier urls?

# Logo
i had a pretty specific idea, but actually i dont want to prime you in any way, so lets just see what you com eup with for starters
do feel free to ask questions about vibes i was feeling though

# Other ideas
- Could be nice to put subtle venue tags next to each paper
